Harnessing ***technology***, ***data***, and ***people*** to understand ***land and water resource systems under environmental change***: using geographic data science, data engineering, and participatory approaches to improve their management.

I am driven by a desire to harness advances in scientific knowledge and digital tech to: 1- address real world environmental challenges (climate change, biodiversity loss, and unsustainable use of natural resources), and 2- encourage and enable others to be aware of the possibilities due to advances in digital tech/data science/data engineering over the past five+ years. 

In addition to my basic fluency in the fast evolving landscape of tools, technologies and their APIs, I wear two other hats: the first being my natural and social science domain expertise in land and water resource systems (primarily in the UK and Malawi) and my work with stakeholders (national level policy advisers, public agencies, water utilities, national parks and other conservation agencies, land managers etc).
